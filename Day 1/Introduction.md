1. What is Cloud Computing


Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services (servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, etc.) over the internet — “the cloud.”

Instead of buying and maintaining physical servers, companies rent computing power from cloud providers like Microsoft Azure.


2. Cloud Service Models (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS)
 IaaS – Infrastructure as a Service

Provider gives virtual machines, networks, storage.

You manage OS, apps, and data.

PaaS – Platform as a Service

Provider manages infrastructure and runtime — you just deploy your code.

No need to worry about OS updates or scaling

SaaS – Software as a Service

Fully managed applications you use via browser or app.
