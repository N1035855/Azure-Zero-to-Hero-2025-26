Today‚Äôs topic is one of the most important in cloud security ‚Äî Azure Identity and Access Control.
We‚Äôll explore how Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) work together to keep your resources secure."

üîç Part 1: Understanding Azure Active Directory 


Azure AD is Microsoft‚Äôs cloud-based identity and access management service.

It helps employees sign in and access resources like:

Microsoft 365,

Azure Portal,

and even third-party apps.

Key points to mention:

Azure AD ‚â† On-premises AD (they are different).

It manages identities using Users, Groups, and Roles.

Authentication methods: password, MFA, SSO, etc.

 Users, Groups, and Roles 

 Azure Portal:

How to create a User.

How to create a Group and add members.

 Directory roles like:

Global Administrator

User Administrator

Billing Administrator

 how grouping simplifies access management.

 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) 

Explain concept:

‚ÄúRBAC helps you control who can do what with which resources.‚Äù

Core elements:

Security Principal: user, group, or service principal

Role Definition: collection of permissions

Scope: management group, subscription, resource group, or individual resource

Assignment: linking principal ‚Üí role ‚Üí scope

Show example:

Assign Reader role to a user for a resource group.

Assign Contributor role to DevOps team for a VM.

 Real-World Example 

‚ÄúImagine you‚Äôre managing a production environment ‚Äî
You don‚Äôt want every developer to delete a database!
Using RBAC, you give them read-only access or a custom role that limits actions.‚Äù
